## Description

Quiz time! This webpage was created to test javascript fundamentals. Once the “start quiz” has been initiated, a question regarding javascript following multiple choice answers will drop down. The timer for quiz has been set to 60 seconds and will notify the user whether they’ve selected the correct answer or not. If correct it will add points to the users score, but if incorrect, not only will the user not get any points but will also lose 10 seconds from overall time to complete the quiz. After the quiz is complete, it will allow the user to enter their initials and submit to log their score. From there the user can either restart the quiz or once done can clear the score from the webpage.
